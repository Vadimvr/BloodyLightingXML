<br/>The path to the lighting that BloodyWorkShop8 uses will be:
<br/>C:\Program Files (x86)\BloodyWorkShop8\BloodyWorkShop8\Data\Mouse\ **English** \SLED\ **Standard2_V8MMax**
<br/>After that, you can create new lighting animations and export them.
<br/>For BloodyWorkShop8 to detect new animations, you need to restart BloodyWorkShop8.
<br/>If the animation was edited and added earlier, a restart is not required.
